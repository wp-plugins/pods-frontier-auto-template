Pods Frontier Auto Display
===========

Automatic front-end output of Pods Templates.

Supports custom post types, Pods extended posts and pages, as well as custom taxonomies.

Requires Pods 2.3.18 or later.

This plugin was created using [Pods Extend](https://github.com/pods-framework/pods-extend), the new Pods Plugin starter plugin, as part of [a series of tutorials on creating Pods Plugins](http://pods.io/tutorials/creating-pods-plugins/).

Instructions
============
For complete instructions see [http://pods.io/tutorials/creating-pods-plugins/using-pods-display/](http://pods.io/tutorials/creating-pods-plugins/using-pods-display/)

In the Pods editor, under the "Frontier Auto Display Options" tab, click the "Enable Automatic Pods Templates for this Pod?" option.

Two new fields will be revealed: "Single item view template" and "Archive view template." In these fields enter the name of Pods Templates that you wish to use in each case.

The "Single item view template" option sets the Pods Template used for individual post pages and the "Archive view template" option sets the Pods Template used for the list of posts in the custom post type. For taxonomies only the "Archive view template" option will be shown.

NOTE: Archives for custom post types must be enabled under the "Advanced Options" tab using the option "Enable Archive Page". By default archives are not enabled.
